Sure, you can set up a cron job to run your Python script every 24 hours at midnight. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the terminal and type crontab -e to edit the cron jobs.

2. If it's your first time running crontab -e, it might ask you to choose an editor. You can choose nano which is the easiest one to use.

3. At the end of the file, add the following line:

``` bash
0 0 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/reports.py
```

This line means: "Run the command /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/reports.py at minute 0 of hour 0 of every day of every month."

Please replace /path/to/your/reports.py with the actual path to your reports.py file.

4. Save the file and exit the editor. If you chose nano, you can do this by pressing Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter.

5. To check your current list of cron jobs, you can use the command crontab -l.

Please note that the cron daemon must be running for the cron jobs to work. It's usually running by default on Ubuntu.

Also, make sure that your Python script can be run directly from the command line and that it has the correct permissions. You might need to add a shebang line at the top of your script like this:

``` python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
```

And make your script executable by running:

``` bash
chmod +x /path/to/your/reports.py
```

Finally, keep in mind that cron jobs run in a minimal environment, so if your script depends on environment variables or has other dependencies on your shell environment, you might need to source your .bashrc or .bash_profile file in the cron job, or set the environment variables directly in the cron job.
